## Introduction
The project is a dense neural network with variable layers and layer sizes as well as its training and testing routines.
It was developed as a way to validate the knowledge aquired in the AI2 classes of THI University about how a dense neural network works in its lowest level

## Math behing 

## Algorithm and function
