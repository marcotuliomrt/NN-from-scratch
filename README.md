## Introduction
The project is a dense neural network with variable layers and layer sizes as well as its training and testing routines.
It was developed as a way to validate the knowledge aquired in the AI2 classes of THI University about how a dense neural network works in its lowest level

## Math behing 

Forward pass:

$\varphi(x)$ : activation function

$z^{[1]} = w^{[1]} \cdot a^{[-1]} + b^{[1]}$

$a^{[1]} = \varphi (z^{[1]})$




## Algorithm and function

Forward function
1. Creates a list with only the input vector inside

## Training process
This is the contributing section.
